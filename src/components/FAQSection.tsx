    question: "I've tried agencies before and got burned. How are you different?",
    answer: "Most agencies run low-budget, ineffective ads, fearing clients won't invest moreâ€”leading to weak results. We optimise for profitable growth, not just cheap leads. With AI-powered appointment setting, elite UGC content, and a multi-channel ad strategy, we consistently deliver qualified, eager-to-buy leads that convert."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I just do this myself?",
    answer: "Sure, but do you have the time to master high-level ad strategies, AI automation, SEO, tracking systems, and UGC contentâ€”while running your business? We bring industry-specific expertise, allowing you to skip years of trial & error and get straight to measurable growth."

    question: "What kind of support do I get?",
    answer: "You'll have direct access via Slack and a client portal in ClickUp to track progress. We provide weekly reports and a clear roadmap during onboarding, so you'll always know what's next. No guesswork, no confusion."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you continue optimizing after launch?",
    answer: "Yes, for Facebook & Google Ads, AI appointment setting, and tracking systems. We refine and scale your campaigns to keep booking high-value clients on autopilot."
  },
  {
    question: "How long until I see results?",
    answer: "For paid ads, expect leads around the 25 day mark from onboarding, AI appointment setting starts converting immediately, and SEO gains momentum within 3-6 monthsâ€”leading to long-term dominance in your local market."
